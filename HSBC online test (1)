/* A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisor, i.e. the sum of its positive divisiors excluding the number itself.

the function accepts an integer 'n' as its argument. Implement the function such that it returns '1' if 'n' is a perfect number ,
else returns the sum of the proper divisors of 'n'.

I/P : 22
O/P : 14

Explanation : proper positive divisors of 22 are 1,2 and 11. 
              1+2+11=14 which is not equal to 22, hence 22 is not a perfect number.
              so the o/p is 14 which is the sum of its proper divisors.
