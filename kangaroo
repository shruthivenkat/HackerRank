//There are two kangaroos on a number line ready to jump in the positive direction (i.e, toward infinity).
//Each kangaroo takes the same amount of time to make a jump, regardless of distance.
//That is, if kangaroo one jumps 3 meters and kangaroo two jumps 5 meters, they each do it in one second, for example.

//Given the starting locations & jump distances for each kangaroo,determine if and when they will land at the same location at the same time.
